# React Pizza Shop Practice

This repository contains a React project that serves as a practice for implementing search functionality and displaying a live clock. The primary features of this project are:

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search through a list of pizzas to find their desired flavor.
- **Live Clock**: The application displays a real-time clock that updates every second.
- **Open/Closed Indicator**: Based on the current time, the application will display whether the pizza shop is "Open" or "Closed".

## Motivation

The main goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate the ability to implement real-time features in a React application. It's a great way to understand the dynamics of state management, component updates, and user interactions in a React-based environment.

## Features

- **Dynamic Search**: As users type in the search bar, the list of pizzas updates in real-time to reflect the search query.
- **Real-time Clock**: Utilizes the `Date` object and `setInterval` to keep the clock ticking.
- **Business Hours Indicator**: The application checks the current time and displays whether the pizza shop is open (from 12 PM to 11 PM) or closed.
